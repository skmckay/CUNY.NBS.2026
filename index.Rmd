Nature-based solutions are a spectrum of actions from more to less naturalized (Figure from Van Rees et al. 2023 PNAS).

# **Course Overview**

Download the syllabus (**coming in 2026**).

This seminar-based course will explore the growing use of nature-based solutions in cities, which are often proposed in the context of simultaneously managing multiple crises related to biodiversity loss, climate change, aging infrastructure, and inequity of natural hazards. Students will explore these topics through reading peer-reviewed literature, agency and project reports, and other resources on the subject. The instructors will guide the class through a critical examination of NBS and their efficacy for accomplishing societal goals, challenges in project execution, and scientific uncertainties. When possible, discussions will include practitioners working in this space, who can provide insights on career trajectories, personal experiences, and disciplinary expertise. This interdisciplinary-oriented course is intended for students from multiple disciplines including environmental sciences, physical sciences, ecology, environmental design, natural resources, marine sciences, anthropology, economics, engineering, and other relevant and related fields. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  

- Define and describe nature-based solutions for addressing urban sustainability challenges.  
- Understand the role of both ecological and built systems in cities.  
- Critically analyze the complex interactions between natural systems and built infrastructure within the context of water resource management.  
- Foster an interdisciplinary approach (and dialog) by integrating knowledge from diverse fields to enhance natural infrastructure practices.


# **Course Format**

The course will emphasize two primary teach modalities. At least once in the semester, participants will attend a field trip to see projects in the New York City area. Discussion and socratic inquiry will be the primary teaching structure in the classroom, and each week will have roughly the following format.  

- Before class each week, students will read 2-3 assigned papers or reports on a focal subject related to nature-based solutions.  
- A brief student-led presentation each week on a topic of their interest related to nature-based solutions (e.g., connections to their research, a case study of interest, a bio of an NBS figure that interests you, a career trajectory related to NBS, etc.).  
- Students will lead and participate in a discussion of the assigned reading.  
- Instructors will present on a current event related to NBS. These may include case studies, ongoing research briefs, visitors from other institutions, and/or important happenings in the field.  
- The instructors will present a brief lecture to contextualize reading materials for the next week.


# **Course Materials**

A variety of written materials will serve as the primary focal point for the class. Each week the instructors and participants will jointly explore these documents with the goal of identifying emergent themes around nature-based solutions.
